DHT Access Tools

What this is
------------

DHT Access Tools is a set of tools to access remotely a DHT operated with
Bamboo DHT or Overlay Weaver. The tools communicates with a node on a
DHT in an XML-RPC protocol.

  Overlay Weaver: An Overlay Construction Toolkit

DHT Shell of Overlay Weaver accepts requests in the XML-RPC protocol
in case that it was invoked with '-x' option. See the manual:
http://overlayweaver.sf.net/doc/manual/dhtshell/

In bin directory, you will find shell scripts to get, put an remove a
key-value pair to/from a DHT. These tools are compatible with
corresponding tools written in Python (src/dht/{put,get,rm}.py in a
Bamboo archive).

There is a publicly accessible DHT service named OpenDHT and we can
test the tools with it.
